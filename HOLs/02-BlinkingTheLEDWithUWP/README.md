# HOL 02 - Blinking the LED with UWP

## Overview

In this lab, we will start with a relatively simple Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app, and run it on the Pi.  If you want a sample that is even simpler than what we do here, check out the <a href="http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/samples/Blinky.htm" target="_blank">Blinky Sample</a> from the <a href="http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/StartCoding.htm" target="_blank">Windows on Devices Docs, Tutorials and Samples</a>

## Pre-Requisites

To complete this lab you must have completed the steps in lab [01 - Installing Windows 10 IoT Core](../HOLs/01-InstallingWindows10IotCore/) 

In addition to the pre-reqs from the [prevoius lab](../HOLs/01-InstallingWindows10IotCore/), you will need:

- Visual Studio 2015 with Update 1 with the following features:
	- "Microsoft Web Developer Tools"
	- "Universal Windows App Development Tools"
- A Solderless Breadboard
- A 5mm LED
- A 330&#0937; Resistor
- A SPST Momentary Pushbutton
- Multiple Male/Female and Male/Male jumper wires.

## Setup

Ensure that you have completed the pre-requisites above. 

## Tasks

### Task 1: Complete the LED and Pushbutton Circuit

In this task you will complete the circuit needed for our first app. 

1. <span style="color: red;">***REMOVE THE POWER AND HDMI CABLES FROM YOUR RASPBERRY PI 2***</span>.  This will ensure that you do not accidentally short-out anything on the board while you are completing the circuit. 

1.  As a reference, you can identify the pins on the Raspberry Pi 2 using the following image (***you can right-click on the image below to open in a new browser window or tab***).

1. Use the following diagram to complete the circuit. <span style="color: red;">***WE WILL BE ADDING ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS IN THE NEXT LAB, DO YOUR BEST TO LAYOUT THE BREADBOARD AS DIGRAMMED BELOW.  THIS WILL ENSURE THERE IS ROOM FOR THE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS ADDED IN THE NEXT LAB***</span> (***you can right-click on the image below to open in a new browser window or tab***):

1. Double check your work, and when you are certain the circuit looks correct, re-connect the HDMI cable, then the Power cable to your Raspberry Pi 2 to boot it up.
