# HOL 02 - Blinking the LED with UWP

## Overview

In this lab, we will start with a relatively simple Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app, and run it on the Pi.  If you want a sample that is even simpler than what we do here, check out the <a href="http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/samples/Blinky.htm" target="_blank">Blinky Sample</a> from the <a href="http://ms-iot.github.io/content/en-US/win10/StartCoding.htm" target="_blank">Windows on Devices Docs, Tutorials and Samples</a>

## Pre-Requisites

To complete this lab you must have completed the steps in lab [01 - Installing Windows 10 IoT Core](../HOLs/01-InstallingWindows10IotCore/) 

In addition to the pre-reqs from the [prevoius lab](../HOLs/01-InstallingWindows10IotCore/), you will need:

- Visual Studio 2015 with Update 1 with the following features:
	- "Microsoft Web Developer Tools"
	- "Universal Windows App Development Tools"
- A Solderless Breadboard
- A 5mm LED
- A 330&#0937; Resistor
- A SPST Momentary Pushbutton
- Multiple Male/Female and Male/Male jumper wires.

## Setup

Ensure that you have completed the pre-requisites above.
